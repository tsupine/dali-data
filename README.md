# DALI Developer Challengesüë©üèæ‚Äçüíª

![](docs/imgs/dali-mondays.gif)

There are several challenges you may complete as a DALI applicant. To be considered as a lab member, you must complete **one** of the challenges. You should choose whichever you feel best showcases your skills and interests.

These challenges allow you try your hand at some design, some coding, and the ins and outs of an essential concept used in software development ‚Äî version control. We'll be using git and GitHub (the site you're at now!) to learn how to manage multiple people working on the same document at the same time ‚Äî all while having the ability to backup and revert your work. If this is all new to you, don't worry! We'll start from the beginning and build from there.

If you get stuck, don't be discouraged! If you have any questions, we encourage you to email us at applications@dali.dartmouth.edu or stop by ECSC 002 during DALI Open Lab Hours (Thursdays 5-7 pm).

## The Theme

Our developer challenges now have a theme! Check the [challenges notion page](https://www.notion.so/dalilab/DALI-Application-Challenges-2a99727739fb4a1b9c49548da435aa86?pvs=4) to see what this term's theme is and instructions on how to use it.

## What to Submit üìã

Show us your coding skills! As a part of your application, we‚Äôll ask you to submit 3 coding samples that you are proud of and think are representative of your skills! We also ask you to write a paragraph for each when you submit discussing what you created, what went well, etc.

One small catch: **at least one** of your samples has to be one of our DALI Developer Challenges. These challenges help emulate some of the real work we do in DALI, and give us an opportunity to see how well you work with guidelines. While we love collaboration, DALI Developer Challenges should be completed **individually**.

The other submissions can be projects you've worked on or code that you have written. We look for these submissions to be creative projects. These can be side projects that you've worked on outside of class or something you learned while prepping for this application. We like to see these open-ended submissions as they demonstrate a passion for coding and give us a unique way to learn about your interests and abilities!

Here are some ideas for side projects to get you started: a to-do list website, a jeopardy board, a basic blog or sticky note app, a basic weather app, a meme generator, an informational page. The opportunities are endless! Don't feel like you need to create something crazy complex. Submit projects that you feel reflect your interests and learning abilities.

Though we appreciate seeing non-class coding samples to better understand your development interests and experiences, we also recognize that not everyone has the time, ability, or experience to pursue side or personal projects outside of class. Therefore, while we **strongly prefer** to see side projects pursued outside of class for your code submissions, you may also submit code from CS class assignments that you are particularly proud of.

If you feel you have not been able to pursue the types of projects listed above (for any reason), please make us aware in your submission. Our application process is holistic.

**TLDR:** please submit the following in your application

1. One of DALI Challenges (details below). This should be a unique coding sample that you have produced specifically for _this application_.
2. Two code samples of personal, side, or class projects.

## Submission Format

The application form will ask you to write a description for each of your coding samples and to provide links to GitHub repos (like this one!). We **highly encourage** you to deploy all code samples, and especially your developer challenge (more info on how to do that below). For each sample, also include: 1) a video walkthrough of what you made and 2) instructions on how to run your code locally. These should be included in your repo's README.

...and don't hesitate to swing by Help Hours with any questions!

## DALI Challenges üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We have three different dev tracks at DALI: web and mobile development, AR/VR development, and data science. Each of them has its own challenge options, which you can see below.

We have a couple of different web development challenges. The first is the [Basic Webpage Challenge](#1-basic-webpage-challenge-). If you've never worked with webdev or built a website before, start here! For those with some experience with webdev, we also have the [API Challenge](#2-api-challenge-) and the [Social Media Challenge](#3-social-media-challenge-%EF%B8%8F). These challenges exist as an opportunity for you to display your knowledge and skills of web development, so please choose the challenge that you think best represents your abilities. Specifically if you have taken cs52, we recommend trying one of these.

For those with some experience in AR, VR, XR, or Unity development, we also have the [Unity Challenge](#arvrunity-challenge-). This challenge exists as an opportunity for you to display your knowledge and skills of Unity and AR/VR/XR. Please choose this challenge if you're specifically interested in working on AR/VR/XR/Unity projects at DALI.

Lastly, we have a [Data Challenge](#data-challenge-). This is for people who might be interested in big data or have taken QSS classes and want to show their skills. If you have familiarity in this area (or want to learn!), consider trying this.

Please note that each of these challenges are for equivalent roles within DALI. While the work is a bit different in each track, all of them involve code. Most of our devs work on full-stack applications, but we also often work on VR and data specialty projects. Regardless of which challenge you submit, you will be considered for the same role as a dev, just under that specific specialization track.

### Web and Mobile Development Challenges

For web and mobile development, we have three different options for challenges. To see more about web and mobile development, find ** this year's theme ** and learn about submission, go to the [Web and Mobile Development README.md](./docs/WebAndMobileChallenges/README.md).

#### 1. Basic Webpage Challenge üê≠

Start here if you're a **beginner to webdev**! (If you already have a personal webpage or have taken cs52, please try one of the other challenges instead.)
